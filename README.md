This is a Tech with Tim tutorial that I followed in order to familiarize myself and begin experimenting with
LangChain as well as AstraDB by Datastax. 

To learn more about LangChain documentation see documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/).

See `requirements.txt` for dependencies. 

**Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository or watch Tech with Tim's tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN7X819DUlQ)
2. Creat a .env file within the project folder that contains the following keys:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=""
ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=""
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=""
ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE=""
OPENAI_API_KEY=""

```
3. Run main.py to interact with AI Agent. 
4. You can ask your AI Agent to save notes about GitHub issues in `notes.txt`# AI_Github_Agent
